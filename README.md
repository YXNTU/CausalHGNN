### ðŸ§  Abstract (shortened)

Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) extend traditional GNNs by integrating multiple relation types and semantic information.  
However, whether HGNNs are **intrinsically effective** remains unclear, as most studies assume rather than establish their causal validity.  

This work disentangles the effects of **model architecture** and **heterogeneous information** through large-scale reproduction across 21 datasets and 20 baselines.  
We introduce a **causal effect estimation framework** that evaluates candidate factors under factual and counterfactual analyses,  
with robustness validated via minimal sufficient adjustment sets, cross-method consistency, and sensitivity analyses.  

Our findings reveal that architectural complexity has **no causal impact** on performance,  
while heterogeneous information improves accuracy by enhancing **homophily** and **localâ€“global distribution discrepancy**,  
making node classes more distinguishable.
